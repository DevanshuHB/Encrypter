# Encrypter
Encrypter is a Python Flask web app inspired by CyberChef, allowing users to create custom "recipes" by chaining 15+ operations like Base64, ROT13, hashing, and ciphers. It supports file uploads, data analysis, visualization, and integrates with MySQL for a responsive, intuitive interface.
