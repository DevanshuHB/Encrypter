Encrypter Project Explanation
=============================

This project is a Python-based web application named "Encrypter," designed as a clone of CyberChef. It provides a user interface for performing various data transformation operations such as encoding, decoding, hashing, and encryption. Users can create a sequence of operations called a "recipe" to apply multiple transformations sequentially.

Key Features:
- Flask backend with routes for main page, adding operations, applying recipes, and data analysis.
- Operations implemented as classes supporting encoding (Base64, Base32, Hex, URL, Caesar cipher, ROT13, ROT47), hashing (MD5, SHA256), and their verification.
- Session-based recipe management allowing users to build and modify operation sequences.
- Data analysis page for encryption strength analysis of selected operation recipes.
- Visualization of analysis results using matplotlib-generated charts embedded as base64 images.
- MySQL database integration for user and recipe data management (schema provided).
- Utility modules for data analysis and file handling.
- User authentication with registration, login, and logout.
- Persistent recipe storage with save and view history features.
- Responsive and user-friendly web interface with clear layout and controls.

Recent Updates:
- Added encryption strength analysis feature accessible via /data-analysis route.
- Refactored /data-analysis page to match the main index.html layout with recipe management.
- Implemented heuristic strength scoring for selected operations with qualitative assessment.
- Added pie chart visualization of strength score.
- Improved error handling and UI feedback on the data analysis page.
- Added user authentication and session management.
- Added persistent recipe saving and history viewing.
- Enhanced UI layout and styling for better user experience.

Testing:
- Basic manual testing of operation addition, recipe application, data analysis, and user authentication.
- Further thorough testing recommended for all UI flows, backend endpoints, and edge cases.

This explanation provides an overview of the project structure, features, and recent enhancements for encryption strength analysis and user management.
